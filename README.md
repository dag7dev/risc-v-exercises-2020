# risc-v-exercises-2020
This repo contains some exercises written in Assembly RISC-V language.

I'm publishing them for archiving purpose and for your pure entertainment since there are not so many examples available about RISC-V (there are a lot of exercises on MIPS but not on RISC-V unfortunately).

Though I wrote every program in my native languagem and personally I don't mantain the sources, feel free to improve the code if you find something that is not working!

#### Requirements:
- Java
- RARS, at the following address: https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars/releases
